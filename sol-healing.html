    <p>Often therapy focuses on thinking or talking your way out of problems. While this can be the answer for some and
      a
      good start for others, sometimes pain and suffering persists. If this feels familiar, you may be in need of a
      more
      body-based, mindfulness approach.</p>

    <p>If you have been in counseling for years or never stepped foot into a therapist’s office, you are welcome here.</p>
    <p>If you’re someone who has been in therapy before but haven’t gotten the exact results you were looking for, <a
        href="http://traumahealing.org/about-us/#about">Somatic Experiencing™</a>&nbsp;(SE) and <a href="https://www.organicintelligence.org/">Organic
        Intelligence<b>®</b></a>
      (OI) sessions may be the missing link for supporting your shift towards greater health and healing. You recognize
      that your body needs help catching up with your mind and know that bringing them into alignment can further
      support
      your healing process.</p>
    <p>If you are someone who has never been to therapy and aren’t sure what to expect, don’t worry! The sessions I
      provide are gentle, easy and sometimes even fun! With curiosity, we explore your individual nervous system’s
      route
      towards health and healing.</p>
    <p>Using SE™ and OI<b>®</b>
      , bottom-up modalities that treat emotional stress, trauma, and other chronic conditions from a nervous system
      perspective, I will shepherd you towards the balance and coherence your body was designed to have. Through
      accessing sensations in your nervous system, your body begins to trend towards resiliency, reorganization and
      ultimately freedom from pain and suffering. As your therapist, I will provide gentle, compassionate and
      non-judgmental reflections of your system’s desire return to the happy, healthy human you were meant to be. You
      have everything you need to do this and I look forward to guiding you.</p>

    <h1 class="entry-title">Bodywork</h1>

    <p>Everyone who has experienced trauma has a story to tell about the experience. It can be important to share this
      experience both in therapy and with those who you know and trust. However, there is often another story that has
      no
      words tied to it at all. This doesn’t mean that the memory of the experience has left your body and nervous
      system.
      You might be able to use rational thinking skills to move into a place where you are aware of being safe and out
      of
      harm’s way; however, you may still experience symptoms of stress and trauma manifesting in your physical body
      through aches, pains, stress or other discomfort. These low or high levels of activation can create reactivity to
      situations and relationships that you may not have previously linked to these traumatic events.</p>
    <p>Bodywork, through the lens of <a href="http://traumahealing.org/about-us/#about">Somatic Experiencing™</a>,
      helps
      to uncover and release what may still be held in the body even after working through a traumatic experience on
      our
      own or previously in talk therapy. As beings, we have natural responses to things all around us. This is no
      different when a traumatic event happens. Unfortunately, during these experiences, we often don’t have time to
      properly prepare or defend ourselves. Or sometimes we override our natural instinct to protect ourselves with
      rational thinking. Following the event, our bodies and nervous systems are left with an incomplete feeling. As a
      result, our physical bodies, thoughts and emotions indirectly respond to past traumas without even realizing that
      this is what is happening.</p>
    <p>The bodywork I provide is a gentle, hands-on approach that helps your body process through sensations,
      behaviors,
      incomplete defensive responses and images in a way that begins to create new meaning and resolution of the
      traumatic event. It can be done as a self-guided process, sitting up in a chair or on a couch, or laying on a
      massage table. The bodywork approach is gentle because it allows you to step away of the verbal story of what
      happened. You do not need to relive the memories stored in order to resolve your trauma. Instead, your body
      guides
      the session, working through its own story, as I follow your movements and sensations.</p>
