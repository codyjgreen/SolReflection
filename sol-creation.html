        Dare to Express your Insides on the Outside

      </h3>

      <p>
        What we wear and how we wear it can be a powerful outlet for self-expression. It’s more than just a fashion
        statement or an art form; it’s a reflection of ourselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Does getting dressed in the morning stress you out? Is your closet full of clothes you never wear? Or have you
        decided you don’t like some aspect of your appearance and therefore have given up trying at all? Maybe you have
        arrived at a place in your life where you want or need to make some changes to your wardrobe due to a new
        career or promotion, the end or beginning of a relationship, a move to a new city or the birth of a baby.
        Making these changes may feel like a difficult or daunting task and I would be delighted to guide you through
        this transformation.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may have arrived here out of curiosity (what even IS Therapeutic Image Consulting and how does it benefit
        me??) or because you are feeling that very desire to change something. Whatever brought you here, I encourage
        you to follow your curiosity and enjoy the exploration.
      </p>

      <p>
        As your sense of self becomes more clearly defined, others will begin to see you in a new light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like other therapies I provide, my job is not to tell you how you should look, feel or be. Therapeutic
        Image Consulting is not about leading you to the latest trends or trying to fit you into a box. My role is to
        shepherd you towards your own cohesive understanding of yourself and help identify what makes you feel most
        like you. Feeling more like yourself feels good! We can breed confidence, enthusiasm, power and clarity as well
        as positively influence our relationships with others.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <p>Consulting sessions can take on a variety of forms.</p>
        <li>
          Office visits are designed to discuss goals, desires, habits, strengths, challenges, body image, spending,
          and
          more;
        </li>
        <li>
          Home visits offer a chance to review the contents of your closet, reorganize, create new pairings you never
          knew you had and determine any gaps in your wardrobe;
        </li>
        <li>
          Outings are created in a gentle and relaxed setting for a therapeutic shopping experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I look forward to helping you define your personal style!
