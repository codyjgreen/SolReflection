    <p>I love what I do. Like truly, deeply love it. I get great satisfaction from being present for the moments when
      people begin to feel more like themselves. I sit in wonderment and admiration as people I work with they start to
      feel the richness and fullness of the life they were intended to have. It is truly an honor to witness a my
      client’s transformations towards joy, fulfillment and happiness.

      I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), and a Somatic Experiencing™ (SE) and Organic Intelligence™ (OI)
      Practitioner, as well as an adjunct teacher of the Organic Intelligence model, Human Empowerment and Resiliency
      Training (HEART™). I hold a Bachelor’s of Social Work from Warren Wilson College and a Master’s of Social Work
      from Columbia University in the city of New York. Following an 8-year career as a Social Worker at the Asheville
      VA Medical Center, working primarily with post-surgical patients and their families, with Veterans in the Mental
      Health Clinic and with homeless Veterans in need of housing across Western North Carolina, I opened a private
      practice near downtown Asheville. In my practice, I offer body-based psychotherapy, SE™-informed bodywork,
      professional and organizational trainings and therapeutic image consulting.

      I look forward to the chance to work with you!
