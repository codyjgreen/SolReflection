        I love what I do. Like truly, deeply love it. I get great satisfaction from being present for the moments when
        people begin to feel more like themselves. I sit in wonderment and admiration as people I work with they start
        to
        feel the richness and fullness of the life they were intended to have. It is truly an honor to witness a my
        client’s transformations towards joy, fulfillment and happiness.
      </p>

        Following an 8-year career as a Social Worker at the Asheville VA Medical Center I opened a private practice
        near
        downtown Asheville. My practice offers mindfulness-based, naturalistic individual, family and group counseling
        sessions. I also offer hands-on bodywork received sitting on a couch, in a chair or on a massage table. In
        addition to more traditional counseling sessions, I also provide body-based therapeutic image consulting for
        those wanting to work not only with their internal body-based experiences, but with their external expressions
        as
        well. For individuals living in different cities, states or countries, I am able to guide my clients through
        body-based sessions via online platforms.

      </p>
      <p>
        I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), and a Somatic Experiencing™ (SE) and Organic Intelligence® (OI)
        Practitioner, as well as an adjunct teacher of the Organic Intelligence model, Human Empowerment and Resiliency
        Training (HEART™). I offer professional and organizational trainings in the Asheville, North Carolina area. In
        addition, I teach students in the Social Work Department at Warren Wilson College. I hold a Bachelor’s of
        Social
        Work from Warren Wilson College and a Master’s of Social Work from Columbia University in the city of New York.

      </p>
      <p>
        I look forward to the opportunity to work with you!
