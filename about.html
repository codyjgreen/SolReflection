    <p>
      I love what I do. Like truly, deeply love it. I get great satisfaction from being present for the moments when
      people begin to feel more like themselves. I sit in wonderment and admiration as people I work with they start to
      feel the richness and fullness of the life they were intended to have. It is truly an honor to witness a my
      client’s transformations towards joy, fulfillment and happiness.

    <p>
      Following an 8-year career as a Social Worker at the Asheville VA Medical Center I opened a private practice near
      downtown Asheville. My practice offers mindfulness-based, naturalistic individual, family and group counseling
      sessions. I also offer hands-on bodywork received sitting on a couch, in a chair or on a massage table. In
      addition to more traditional counseling sessions, I also provide body-based therapeutic image consulting for
      those wanting to work not only with their internal body-based experiences, but with their external expressions as
      well. For individuals living in different cities, states or countries, I am able to guide my clients through
      body-based sessions via online platforms.

    </p>

      I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), and a Somatic Experiencing™ (SE) and Organic Intelligence® (OI)
      Practitioner, as well as an adjunct teacher of the Organic Intelligence model, Human Empowerment and Resiliency
      Training (HEART™). I offer professional and organizational trainings in the Asheville, North Carolina area. In
      addition, I teach students in the Social Work Department at Warren Wilson College. I hold a Bachelor’s of Social
      Work from Warren Wilson College and a Master’s of Social Work from Columbia University in the city of New York.

    </p>
    <p>
      I look forward to the opportunity to work with you!
